This is a AI genetic algorithm program I wrote to find the maximum and minimum of this function 	f (w,x,y,z)  = (sin(Ω(x+w))2(sin(Ω(y+z))2e-(w+x+y+z)/150
It allows changing of the following variables Max Generations, Population Size, Mutation Rage, How good you have to be to reproduce, How many Elites move 
on, two different types of mutation and a few others. Although this program was built to maxize and minimize the function
given, it was written in a way it could easily be changed to maximize/minamize any function through machine learning.
